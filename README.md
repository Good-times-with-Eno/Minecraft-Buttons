Welcome!
This is a personal project that I am making, aiming to code Minecraft with buttons.
Development will be slow, so please be patient.
Any issues or questions can be posted on the issues tab. I will try to answer as soon as possible.
Thanks people!
**IMPORTANT**
**Pygame and cryptography is required for this project to work. To install pygame, go into your terminal, and type "pip3 install pygame" and "pip3 install cryptography".**



**To play this game, you will need an IDE such as Visual Code studio or Pycharm. To download these applications, go to https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/, or https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools.**

**Simply put the folder onto your IDE, and run main.py. Make sure that the folder is the main directory of the IDE (I'm sure there are lots of resources out there if you need help).**
